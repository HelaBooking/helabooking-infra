# Branching Strategy - Helabooking Infra Repository

## Overview

This document outlines the branching strategy adopted for the Helabooking Infrastructure repository. The strategy is design to deploy IaC changes efficiently in each environment while ensuring stability and reliability.

## Branch Structure

- **Main Branch**: The `main` branch serves as the production-ready branch.
- **Environment Branches**: Separate branches are maintained for each environment:
  - `on-prem-management`: On-Premises Cluster Management
  - `dev`: Development environment
  - `qa`: Staging environment
  - `cloud-management`: Cloud Cluster Management
  - `stage`: Pre-production environment
  - `main`: Production environment
- **Change Branches**: Feature or change branches are created from the respective environment branches for implementing changes in to respective environments.
  - Naming Convention: `env/change-description` (e.g., `dev/add-new-service`, `qa/update-configuration`)

## Workflow

1. **Creating Change Branches**: Members create change branches from the respective environment branches.
2. **Implementing Changes**: Changes are implemented and tested in `dev` environment using Terraform CLI. Then changes are promoted to `qa` and `stage` environments for further testing.
3. **Pull Requests**: Once changes are tested, a pull request is created for the respective environment.
4. **Code Review**: Peers review the changes and approve the pull request.
5. **Merging Changes**: After approval, the change branch is merged into the respective environment branch.
6. **Deployment**: Approve the Terraform plan for respective environment in Jenkins.
7. **Deleting Change Branches**: After merging, the change branches are deleted to keep the repository clean.
