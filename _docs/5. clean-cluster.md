# Environment CleanUP

1. Stop the k3s service on all nodes:
   `sudo /usr/local/bin/k3s-killall.sh`

2. Run the following command on all nodes to uninstall k3s:

   - On the server node (Raspberry Pi):
     `/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh`

   - On the agent node (Samsung Laptop):
     `/usr/local/bin/k3s-agent-uninstall.sh`

3. Remove any remaining k3s directories and files:

   - On all nodes, run:
     `sudo rm -rfv /var/lib/rancher /etc/rancher/ /var/lib/longhorn/ /var/lib/kubelet /etc/kubernetes /var/run/k3s.sock /var/log/k3s.log`
     `sudo rm -rfv /longhorn`

4. Reboot all nodes to ensure all services are stopped and changes take effect:
   `sudo reboot`
